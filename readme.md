Abstract:
Pretrained language models excel in various natural language processing tasks but often neglect the integration of different scripts within a language, constraining their ability to capture richer semantic information, such as in Hindi. In this work, we present a dual-script-enhanced feature representation method for Hindi. We combine single-script features from Devanagari and Romanized Hindi Roberta using concatenation, addition, cross-attention, and convolutional networks. The experiment results show that using a dual-script approach significantly improves model performance across various tasks. The addition fusion technique excels in sequence generation tasks, while for text classification, the CNN-based dual-script enhanced representation performs best with longer sentences, and the addition fusion technique is more effective for shorter sequences. Our approach shows significant advantages in multiple natural language processing tasks, providing a new perspective on feature representation for Hindi.
